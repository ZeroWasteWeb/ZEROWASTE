        <h2>The Harvest Hub Vision</h2>
        <p>Our vision supports the mission of <strong>Zero waste, Zero hunger</strong> by making sure edible food never goes to waste and reaches people who need it most. We work to create a sustainable system where surplus food from farms, retailers, and restaurants is redirected to local communities instead of ending up in landfills.</p>
        <h3>Pillars of Our Work</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Recovering surplus and near-expiry food to reduce waste while providing meals for families in need.</li>
            <li>Helping businesses understand and reduce their food waste, supporting a cleaner and more responsible food ecosystem.</li>
            <li>Working with volunteers, food banks, and shelters to distribute rescued food fairly and efficiently.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Every kilogram of food saved is a step toward a sustainable future and a meal for a hungry neighbor.</p>
